# 👩‍🏫👨‍🏫 Staking Course Design App

> This project was created for the ETH NYC Hacakthon organized by ETH Global 

The app will allow users to create courses with built-in crypto incentives!

Here's what a course created with the Staking Course Design app looks like:

1. Students stake funds to get access to the course
2. Students can get a share of their funds back as they complete steps of the course
3. Students are issued NFTs that show they've completed a step of the course.

🧪 A course creator you can use the contracts that are created with these built-in mechanisms! 

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

1. Prerequisites: [Node (v16 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

2. Clone/fork 🏗 this repo 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carletex/ethnyc-2022.git
```

3. Install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd ethnyc-2022
yarn install
yarn chain
```

4. In a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd ethnyc-2022
yarn start
```

5. In a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd ethnyc-2022
yarn deploy
```

6. 📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app

7. Create a new course on the Course Adim Page. 

8. Once the contract(a) are deployed for a new course. Get the address of the staking course and add it to SignUpPage.jsx: The staking contract address (line 14). You will also need to add the address of the NFT Badge contract to MyBadges.jsx: The badges contract address (line 9).

# 💌 P.S.

🌍 You need an RPC key for testnets and production deployments, create an [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account and replace the value of `ALCHEMY_KEY = xxx` in `packages/react-app/src/constants.js` with your new key.

📣 Make sure you update the `InfuraID` before you go to production. Huge thanks to [Infura](https://infura.io/) for our special account that fields 7m req/day!
